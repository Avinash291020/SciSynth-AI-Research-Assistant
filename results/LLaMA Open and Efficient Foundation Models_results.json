We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly avail- able datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3( 175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA- 65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release all our models to the research community1.\n\nMain Topic:\nThis paper focuses on Open and Efﬁcient Foundation Language Models Hugo Touvron, Thibaut Lavril, Gautier Izacard, Xavier Martinet Marie-Anne Lachaux, Timothee Lacroix, Baptiste Rozière, Naman Goyal Eric Hambro, Faisal Azhar, Aurelien Rodriguez, Armand Joulin Edouard Grave, Guillaume Lample Meta AI Abstract We introduce LLaMA, a collection of founda- tion language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters.

However, this objective disregards the inference budget, which becomes critical when serving a language model at scale.\n\nKey Points:\n1. 1 Introduction Large Languages Models( LLMs) trained on mas- sive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per- form new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples( Brown et al.\n2. These few-shot properties ﬁrst appeared when scaling models to a sufﬁcient size( Kaplan et al.\n3. , 2020) , resulting in a line of work that focuses on further scaling these models( Chowdhery et al.",
  "hypotheses": "Research Hypotheses:\n\n1. Research exploring Open and Efﬁcient Foundation Language Models Hugo Touvron, Thibaut Lavril,... could lead to novel approaches that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of current methodologies.\n\n2. Building upon the finding that 1 Introduction Large Languages Models( LLMs) trained on mas- sive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per- form new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples( Brown et al., we hypothesize that integrating these insights with emerging technologies could lead to breakthrough applications.\n\n3. Based on the observation that 1 Introduction Large Languages Models( LLMs) trained on mas- sive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per- form new tasks from textual instructions or from a few examples( Brown et al., we hypothesize that further investigation could reveal new theoretical frameworks and practical applications.\n\n4.
