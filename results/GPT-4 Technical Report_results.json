While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10 of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer- based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4s performance based on models trained with no more than 11, 000th the compute of GPT-4.\n\nMain Topic:\nThis paper focuses on GPT-4 Technical Report OpenAI Abstract We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs.
