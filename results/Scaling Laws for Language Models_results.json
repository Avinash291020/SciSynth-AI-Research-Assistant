These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a ﬁxed compute budget.\n2. Larger models are signiﬁcantly more sample- efﬁcient, such that optimally compute-efﬁcient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping signiﬁcantly before convergence.\n3. Contributions: Jared Kaplan and Sam McCandlish led the research.",
