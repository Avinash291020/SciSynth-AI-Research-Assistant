In our work we use lattice-QCD simulations with temporal ex- tents of 𝑁𝜏 8, 10 and 12 to quantify corrections to the ideal HRG.\n3. Firstly, we determine a number of subleading fugacity expansion coeﬃcients of the QCD free energy via a two-dimensional scan on the imaginary baryon number chemical potential( 𝜇𝐵) - strangeness chemical potential( 𝜇𝑆) plane.",
