Neuro-Symbolic Artiﬁcial Intelligence the combination of symbolic methods with methods that are based on artiﬁcial neural networks has a long-standing history. In this article, we provide a structured overview of current trends, by means of categorizing recent publications from key conferences.

Le 1 Abstract Machine learning research has advanced in multi- ple aspects, including model structures and learn- ing methods. The effort to automate such re- search, known as AutoML, has also made sig- niﬁcant progress. However, this progress has largely focused on the architecture of neural net- works, where it has relied on sophisticated expert- designed layers as building blocksor similarly restrictive search spaces. Our goal is to show that AutoML can go further: it is possible today to au- tomatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical opera- tions as building blocks. We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that signiﬁcantly reduces human bias through a generic search space. Despite the vastness of this space, evo- lutionary search can still discover two-layer neu- ral networks trained by backpropagation.\n\nMain Topic:\nThis paper focuses on it is possible today to au- tomatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical opera- tions as building blocks.

We ﬁrst show that larger models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice and truefalse questions when they are provided in the right format.",

While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10 of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer- based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior.

Furthermore, on two interactive decision making benchmarks( ALFWorld and WebShop) , ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34 and 10 respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.\n\nKey Points:\n1. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-speciﬁc actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments.\n2. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines in addition to improved human interpretability and trustworthiness.\n3. Concretely, on question answering( HotpotQA) and fact veriﬁcation( Fever) , ReAct overcomes prevalent issues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces.",

Concretely, on question answering( HotpotQA) and fact veriﬁcation( Fever) , ReAct overcomes prevalent issues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces."

The human body expresses the use of cognitive resources through physiological responses when confronted with a plethora of cognitive workload..\n\nAbstract Summary:\nThis temporarily mobilizes additional resources to deal with the workload at the cost of accelerated mental exhaustion. Firstly, we show that electroencephalography is a reliable modality to assess the mental workload generated during the user interface operation.\n\nKey Points:\n1. This temporarily mobilizes additional resources to deal with the workload at the cost of accelerated mental exhaustion.\n2. We predict that recent developments in physiological sensing will increasingly create user interfaces that are aware of the users cognitive capacities, hence able to intervene when high or low states of cognitive workload are detected.\n3. In this thesis, we initially focus on determining opportune moments for cognitive assistance.",

Griffiths Princeton University Yuan Cao Google DeepMind Karthik Narasimhan Princeton University Abstract Language models are increasingly being deployed for general problem solving across a wide range of tasks, but are still confined to token-level, left-to-right decision-making processes during inference. This means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, Tree of Thoughts( ToT) , which generalizes over the popular Chain of Thought approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text( thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving.\n\nMain Topic:\nThis paper focuses on Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models Shunyu Yao Princeton University Dian Yu Google DeepMind Jeffrey Zhao Google DeepMind Izhak Shafran Google DeepMind Thomas L.

To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, Tree of Thoughts( ToT) , which generalizes over the popular Chain of Thought approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text( thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving..\n\nAbstract Summary:\nToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. It is perhaps surprising that underlying all this progress is still the original autoregressive mechanism for generating text, which makes token-level decisions one by one and in a left-to-right fashion.\n\nKey Points:\n1. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices.\n2. Our experiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords.\n3. For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4 of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74.",
