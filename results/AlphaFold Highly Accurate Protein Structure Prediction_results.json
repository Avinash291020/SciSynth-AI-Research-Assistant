We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction( CASP14) 15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.\n\nKey Points:\n1. Through an enormous experimental effort14, the structures of around 100, 000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6, 7.\n2. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure.\n3. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics.",
  "hypotheses": "Research Hypotheses:\n\n1. Research exploring Nature Vol 596 26 August 2021 583 Article Highly accurate... could lead to novel approaches that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of current methodologies.\n\n2. Building upon the finding that Through an enormous experimental effort14, the structures of around 100, 000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6, 7., we hypothesize that integrating these insights with emerging technologies could lead to breakthrough applications.\n\n3. Based on the observation that Through an enormous experimental effort14, the structures of around 100, 000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6, 7., we hypothesize that further investigation could reveal new theoretical frameworks and practical applications.\n\n4. Based on the observation that Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure., we hypothesize that further investigation could reveal new theoretical frameworks and practical applications.",
