We ﬁrst show that larger models are well-calibrated on diverse multiple choice and truefalse questions when they are provided in the right format..\n\nAbstract Summary:\nThus we can approach self-evaluation on open-ended sampling tasks by asking models to ﬁrst propose answers, and then to evaluate the probability P( True) that their answers are correct. We hope these observations lay the groundwork for training more honest models, and for investigating how honesty generalizes to cases where models are trained on objectives other than the imitation of human writing.\n\nKey Points:\n1. Thus we can approach self-evaluation on open-ended sampling tasks by asking models to ﬁrst propose answers, and then to evaluate the probability P( True) that their answers are correct.\n2. We ﬁnd encouraging performance, calibration, and scaling for P( True) on a diverse array of tasks.\n3. Performance at self-evaluation further improves when we allow models to consider many of their own samples before predicting the va- lidity of one speciﬁc possibility.",
