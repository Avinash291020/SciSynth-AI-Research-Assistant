This increases the diﬃculty of a given task, adding to the existing workload and leading to compromised cognitive performances. The human body expresses the use of cognitive resources through physiological responses when confronted with a plethora of cognitive workload.\n\nMain Topic:\nThis paper focuses on 11. 05. 2020 iv Abstract Abstract In todays society, our cognition is constantly inﬂuenced by information intake, attention switching, and task interruptions. This increases the diﬃculty of a given task, adding to the existing workload and leading to compromised cognitive performances. The human body expresses the use of cognitive resources through physiological responses when confronted with a plethora of cognitive workload..\n\nAbstract Summary:\nThis temporarily mobilizes additional resources to deal with the workload at the cost of accelerated mental exhaustion. Firstly, we show that electroencephalography is a reliable modality to assess the mental workload generated during the user interface operation.\n\nKey Points:\n1. This temporarily mobilizes additional resources to deal with the workload at the cost of accelerated mental exhaustion.\n2. We predict that recent developments in physiological sensing will increasingly create user interfaces that are aware of the users cognitive capacities, hence able to intervene when high or low states of cognitive workload are detected.\n3. In this thesis, we initially focus on determining opportune moments for cognitive assistance.",

Research exploring 11. 05. 2020 iv Abstract Abstract In todays society, our... could lead to novel approaches that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of current methodologies.\n\n2. Building upon the finding that This temporarily mobilizes additional resources to deal with the workload at the cost of accelerated mental exhaustion., we hypothesize that integrating these insights with emerging technologies could lead to breakthrough applications.\n\n3. Based on the observation that This temporarily mobilizes additional resources to deal with the workload at the cost of accelerated mental exhaustion., we hypothesize that further investigation could reveal new theoretical frameworks and practical applications.\n\n4.
