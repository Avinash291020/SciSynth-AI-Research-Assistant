Furthermore, on two interactive decision making benchmarks( ALFWorld and WebShop) , ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34 and 10 respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.\n\nKey Points:\n1. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-speciﬁc actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments.\n2. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines in addition to improved human interpretability and trustworthiness.\n3. Concretely, on question answering( HotpotQA) and fact veriﬁcation( Fever) , ReAct overcomes prevalent issues of hallucination and error propagation in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generating human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces.",
