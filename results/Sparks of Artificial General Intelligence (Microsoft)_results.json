The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4 Ope23, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that( this early version of) GPT- 4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs( along with ChatGPT and Googles PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models.\n\nMain Topic:\nThis paper focuses on Early experiments with GPT-4 Sebastien Bubeck Varun Chandrasekaran Ronen Eldan Johannes Gehrke Eric Horvitz Ece Kamar Peter Lee Yin Tat Lee Yuanzhi Li Scott Lundberg Harsha Nori Hamid Palangi Marco Tulio Ribeiro Yi Zhang Microsoft Research Abstract Artiﬁcial intelligence( AI) researchers have been developing and reﬁning large language models( LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition.

We conclude with reﬂections on societal inﬂuences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.\n\nKey Points:\n1. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models.\n2. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and diﬃcult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting.\n3. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4s performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT.",
