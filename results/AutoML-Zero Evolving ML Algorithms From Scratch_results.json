Le 1 Abstract Machine learning research has advanced in multi- ple aspects, including model structures and learn- ing methods. The effort to automate such re- search, known as AutoML, has also made sig- niﬁcant progress. However, this progress has largely focused on the architecture of neural net- works, where it has relied on sophisticated expert- designed layers as building blocksor similarly restrictive search spaces. Our goal is to show that AutoML can go further: it is possible today to au- tomatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical opera- tions as building blocks. We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that signiﬁcantly reduces human bias through a generic search space. Despite the vastness of this space, evo- lutionary search can still discover two-layer neu- ral networks trained by backpropagation.\n\nMain Topic:\nThis paper focuses on it is possible today to au- tomatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical opera- tions as building blocks.
