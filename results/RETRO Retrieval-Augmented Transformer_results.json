After ﬁne-tuning, Retro performance translates to downstream knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering.\n2. Retro combines a frozen Bert retriever, a diﬀerentiable encoder and a chunked cross-attention mechanism to predict tokens based on an order of magnitude more data than what is typically consumed during training.\n3. We typically train Retro from scratch, yet can also rapidly Retroﬁt pre-trained transformers with retrieval and still achieve good performance.",
