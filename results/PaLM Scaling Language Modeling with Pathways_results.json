We demonstrate continued beneﬁts of scaling by achieving state-of- the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks.\n\nKey Points:\n1.

To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model( PaLM) .\n3. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly eﬃcient training across multiple TPU Pods.",
