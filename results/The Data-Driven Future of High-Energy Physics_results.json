Correspondence Email: chowdh23purdue. edu Abstract A mirrored bilayer structure incorporating layers of Graphene and MoS2 is proposed here for Surface Plasmon Resonance( SPR) biosensing and its performance is evaluated numerically. Starting from the basic conﬁguration, the structure with graphene and MoS2 layers is gradually developed for enhanced performance. Reﬂectance is the main considered parameter for performance analysis. A theoretical framework based on Fresnels equations is presented and by measuring reﬂectance versus angle of incidence, sensitivity is calculated from the displacement of SPR angle using ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain( FDTD) technique.\n\nMain Topic:\nThis paper focuses on chowdh23purdue. edu Abstract A mirrored bilayer structure incorporating layers of Graphene and MoS2 is proposed here for Surface Plasmon Resonance( SPR) biosensing and its performance is evaluated numerically.

Eﬀorts focusing on sensitivity enhancement lies at the core of surface plasmon resonance( SPR) biosensing research as it paves the way for detecting tiny variations in the sensing layer which can be critical in revealing disease onsets.\n\nKey Points:\n1. Our numerical analysis shows that using the proposed approach, about 4.\n2. 2 times enhanced sensitivity can be achieved compared to the basic Kretschmann conﬁguration.\n3. Notably, the structure provides enhancement for both angular and wavelength interrogations.",
