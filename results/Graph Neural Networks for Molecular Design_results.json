The existence of these granular structures became apparent since the invention of laser1 and yet up to these days we still keep learning about their fundamental properties24 and the range of applications they enable, spanning from imaging58 to spectroscopy9 and cryptography, 10 to name a few.\n\nKey Points:\n1. Furthermore, its proper theoretical description poses enormous challenges.\n2. Here we report on the ﬁrst direct measurements of spatially resolved intensity correlations of light inside a disordered medium, using embedded DNA strings decorated with emitters separated by a controlled nanometric distance.\n3. Our method provides in situ access to fundamental properties of bulk speckles as their size and polarization degrees of freedom, both of which are found to deviate signiﬁcantly from theoretical predictions.",
