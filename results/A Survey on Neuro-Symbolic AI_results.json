Neuro-Symbolic Artiﬁcial Intelligence the combination of symbolic methods with methods that are based on artiﬁcial neural networks has a long-standing history. In this article, we provide a structured overview of current trends, by means of categorizing recent publications from key conferences. The article is meant to serve as a convenient starting point for research on the general topic. Keywords: Artiﬁcial Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Neuro-Symbolic Artiﬁcial Intelligence 1. What Is Neuro-Symbolic Artiﬁcial Intelligence? We should begin by attempting to deﬁne the subject matter.\n\nMain Topic:\nThis paper focuses on Artiﬁcial Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Neuro-Symbolic Artiﬁcial Intelligence 1. What Is Neuro-Symbolic Artiﬁcial Intelligence? We should begin by attempting to deﬁne the subject matter..\n\nAbstract Summary:\nIn a general sense, we understand Neuro-Symbolic Artiﬁcial Intelligence( in short, NeSy AI) , to be a subﬁeld of the ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence( in short, AI) , which focuses on bringing together, for added value, the neural and the symbolic traditions in AI. The lines easily blur, though, and for the purposes of this overview, we will not restrict ourselves to logic-based methods only.\n\nKey Points:\n1. In a general sense, we understand Neuro-Symbolic Artiﬁcial Intelligence( in short, NeSy AI) , to be a subﬁeld of the ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence( in short, AI) , which focuses on bringing together, for added value, the neural and the symbolic traditions in AI.\n2. Different spellings are currently in use, that include neural-symbolic and neurosymbolic, but also symbolic-subsymbolic and others  which we consider to be equal.\n3. The term neural in this case refers to the use of artiﬁcial neural networks, or connectionist systems, in the widest sense.",
  "hypotheses": "Research Hypotheses:\n\n1. Research exploring Artiﬁcial Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Neuro-Symbolic... could lead to novel approaches that enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of current methodologies.\n\n2. Building upon the finding that In a general sense, we understand Neuro-Symbolic Artiﬁcial Intelligence( in short, NeSy AI) , to be a subﬁeld of the ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence( in short, AI) , which focuses on bringing together, for added value, the neural and the symbolic traditions in AI., we hypothesize that integrating these insights with emerging technologies could lead to breakthrough applications.\n\n3. Based on the observation that In a general sense, we understand Neuro-Symbolic Artiﬁcial Intelligence( in short, NeSy AI) , to be a subﬁeld of the ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence( in short, AI) , which focuses on bringing together, for added value, the neural and the symbolic traditions in AI., we hypothesize that further investigation could reveal new theoretical frameworks and practical applications.\n\n4.
