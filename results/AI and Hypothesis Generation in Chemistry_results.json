Backpropagated ﬁnite diﬀerence frequency domain( FDFD) simulations are used to design waveguides and demultiplexers operating under both transverse electric( TE) and transverse mag- netic( TM) modes. Demultiplexing and waveguiding are demonstrated for devices composed of plasma elements with reasonable plasma densities 7 GHz, allowing for future in-situ training and experimental realization of these designs.\n\nMain Topic:\nThis paper focuses on June 10, 2021) We apply inverse design methods to produce two-dimensional plasma metamaterial( PMM) de- vices.

Typically, the performance criteria is encoded as an objective function that needs to be max- imized or minimized.\n\nKey Points:\n1. We also explore the possible applicability of PMMs to nonlinear boolean operations for use in optical computing.\n2. Functionally complete logical connectives( OR and AND) are achieved in the TM mode.\n3. INTRODUCTION Inverse design methodology is an algorithmic technique by which optimal solutions are iteratively approximated from an a priori set of performance metrics.",
